# Hi, This is Busra! ðŸ‘‹
___
I have recently completed my master's degree in Mechatronics and I am particularly interested in Artificial Intelligence and new technologies in Robotics and IoT.
As my master's thesis, I worked on Deep Learning techniques for Medical Image Analysis. The topic was to optimize Artificial Neural Network Architectures for the detection of herniated lumbar disc on MRI data. Now I am looking forward to building a career in Data Science and Machine learning fields. I am mostly here to improve my skills as a Data Scientist by helping others or getting help.




- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my master's thesis. The aim of my master's thesis is to detect the lumbar disc herniation on MRI data with the help of Deep Learning techniques.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to do Semantic Segmentation on Medical Image data.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with U-Net architecture
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: dm me on twitter or drop an email
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a N00b in here
